<p>- Advanced code understanding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Postfix code completion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Partial PHP 7 support</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Inline debugger for PHP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Remote edit</p>
<p>One of the most demanded features in PhpStorm history is here! Individual files can now be opened directly from the remote host (such as FTP, SFTP or FTPS) and edited in the IDE, without adding/downloading them to the local project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Remote tools via remote PHP interpreters</p>
<p>Remote PHP interpreters (introduced in PhpStorm 8) let you run your application and tools on a production-like environment. You can easily use Vagrant-run virtualized environment with all the tools in place. In PhpStorm 9, so-called remote development (when your development environment is not local) becomes a reality, with support for PHP Code Sniffer and Mess Detector via remote PHP interpreters</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Improved JavaScript support</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Application dependency diagrams</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Tracing languages transpiled to JavaScript</p>
<p>and others..</p>
