<p>Stubs</p>
<p>The practice of replacing an object with a test double that (optionally) returns configured return values is referred to as stubbing. You can use a stub to "replace a real component on which the SUT depends so that the test has a control point for the indirect inputs of the SUT. This allows the test to force the SUT down paths it might not otherwise execute".</p>

<p>Mock Objects</p>
<p>The practice of replacing an object with a test double that verifies expectations, for instance asserting that a method has been called, is referred to as mocking.</p>
