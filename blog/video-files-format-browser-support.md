<h3>So which of these file types do you need for your website? Well ideally all 3 would be great as they provide the full support spectrum. Yet this isn&rsquo;t realistic, and in fact, you can cover all the bases with only two of them. Here is a breakdown of what works for each browser:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Firefox &ndash; WebM, Ogg</li>
<li>Google Chrome &ndash; WebM, Ogg</li>
<li>Opera &ndash; WebM, Ogg</li>
<li>Safari &ndash; MP4</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 9 &ndash; MP4</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 6-8 &ndash; No HTML5, Flash Only!</li>
</ul>
